# OpenCV Course
Before starting the course, install the *Remote - Container* extension if you have not done so already. After installing the extensions, click the icon in the lower left corner and select *Reopen in Container*.

## Exercise 1 - Reading and displaying images
This exercise is primarily meant as a test to check if your system is correctly set up to complete the course. It is also meant as an introduction to the OpenCV documentation, which you will visit frequently in your work in the perception group. Use the provided resources to complete all TODOs in exercise_1.py. When finished, run your program by hitting Ctrl+F5, or by running `python3 exercise_1.py` in the terminal.

When attempting to run your program for the first time you might get the warning `Authorization required, but no authorization protocol specified`, followed by the error `Can't initialize GTK backend in function 'cvInitSystem'`. This is because processes created inside the container are not authorized to communicate with your windowing system. Disable access control to your windowing system by running `xhost +` in any terminal (outside of the container). Access control can be re-enabled by at any time by running `xhost -`.
